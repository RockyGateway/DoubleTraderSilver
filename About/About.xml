    <description>This mod should be save game compatible, I've had no issues. 
	All this mod does is double the minimum and maximum silver a base/caravan/traveler/ship can have. 
	I have no coding knowledge so this was done in a very lazy way so it may not be compatible with other mods that change traders inventories.
