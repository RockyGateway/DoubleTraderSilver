# DoubleTraderSilver
A mod for RimWorld 1.4.

This mod doubles the silver that all Caravans\Travlers\Ships\Bases carry.

This mod is compatible with saved games.

I have no coding knowledge so I made this mod in a really lazy stupid way. I have no idea if this mod works correctly with other mods that change what traders carry.
